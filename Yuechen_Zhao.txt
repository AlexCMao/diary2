Saturday, Mar 14 – First day in Maine, and it rains. What are the chances that the first and (maybe?) only trip that I’m going to take this semester is going to be gloomy and rainy? Decided to sign up for my Netflix free trial to pass the time and was presented with the screen to select 3 movies or TV shows that I’ve watched and liked so that they can recommend stuff to watch. But I think their model/experience must be flawed because there were only three movies or TV shows that I’ve seen in that list, period. There must be a better way to provide initial inputs into their Netflix model.
