I'm increasingly confident that the only reason we don't use neural nets for everything ever is that they are inconvenient. It's super easy to take first differences, second differences, and more; the only problem is that it's annoying to take gradients of big neural nets, but that's automated too now, via packages like Kayak. I think I'm going to ask Gary about it and see what he says. Political scientists have their methods of research in which we look at P-values; economists write a formal model, run an experiment, and see if the model's results match the data; computer scientists run computing time experiments and stuff. I would like to do a hybrid, where I run a neural net and generate predictions, then test the predictions by running a survey experiment or something. It seems like a reasonable response to economists.
