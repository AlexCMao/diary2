Was studying algorithms and data structures and came across this visualization for counting the number of inversions in an array (elements out of sorted order, basically):

1   2   3   4   5   6
|	 \	/	 \ /	|
|	  \/	  \		|
|	  /\     / \	|
|	 / 	\   /   \	|
|	| 	 \ /    |	|
|	|  	  /     |	|
|	|  	 / \    |	|
1   3   5   2   4   6

The number of inversion is equal to the number of intersections! Looks much cooler with straight lines (and when drawn by hand). Even though the concept is pretty simple, I think it becomes even clearer with this visualization, as crossing lines indicate deviations from the equilibrium state where all lines are vertical. Brilliant communication of variation, in my opinion. 

edit: seems like this is like a rotated bumps chart
